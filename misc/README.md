# Misc Folder

This folder contains the `databaseBuilder.py` Python script used for building the
SQLite database `flutter_pokedex/assets/pokemonDatabase.db` needed for by the Pok√©dex.

It uses the `requests` python package in order to get the JSON file from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co).

Run `pip3 install requests` to install the package.
